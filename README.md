## ⚡ Why r\_delta?

Most delta tools solve only half the problem (deduplication). `r_delta` solves the whole transport layer:

* **Shift Resistant:** Uses FastCDC (Gear Hash) to align chunks based on content, not offsets.
* **Adaptive Transport:** Intelligently chooses the optimal transfer strategy:
    * *Small Files (< 100KB):* Direct Zstd compression (bypasses CDC overhead, 30-80% savings).
    * *Large Files:* Full CDC pipeline with delta computation for maximum deduplication.
* **Hybrid Efficiency:**
    * *Known Data:* Deduplicated via `COPY` instructions (O(1) HashMap lookup).
    * *New Data:* Compressed via `COMPRESSED_LITERAL` instructions (Zstd level 3).
    * *Sequential Data:* Optimized via `SKIP` instructions (~5% metadata reduction).
* **Memory Safe:** Streaming architecture with 8MB buffer limits prevents RAM spikes, regardless of file size.
* **Professional UX:** Real-time progress bars, spinners, and deduplication reports show exactly what's happening.
* **Telemetry:** Structured logging with performance metrics (throughput, duration, savings).
* **Forensic Integrity:** Bit-level verification tool guarantees `Original == Recreated`.
* **Network Ready:** QUIC-based transport with automatic delta detection and cryptographic verification.

## The Problem CDC Solves: Shift Resistance

### Legacy Fixed Chunking
```
Source File:   [AAAA] [BBBB] [CCCC] [DDDD]

Insert 1 byte at start:
Target File:   [XAAA] [ABBB] [BCCC] [CDDD]
                       ↑ Everything shifted by 1 byte
Result: 0% deduplication. Must re-transmit entire file.
```

### r_delta with FastCDC (Content-Defined Chunking)
```
Source File:   [AAAA] [BBBB] [CCCC] [DDDD]

Insert 1 byte at start:
Target File:   [X] [AAAA] [BBBB] [CCCC] [DDDD]
                ↑ New chunk    ↑ Rest re-aligns to content boundaries
Result: ~99% deduplication. Only transmit the new byte + metadata.
```

**Why It Matters:** One byte insertion in the middle of a 1GB file used to require re-transmitting the entire file. Now only the delta is sent.

## 🛠 Installation

`r_delta` is must be built from source using Cargo workspaces.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abraham1003/r_delta
cd r_delta
cargo build --release
```

The binaries will be compiled to:
- `./target/release/r_delta` (client CLI)
- `./target/release/r_delta_server` (server daemon)

**Note:** The CLI tool is not yet published to crates.io.

### Workspace Structure

The repository is structured as a workspace with three crates:
- **`crates/core`** - The core library (Apache 2.0) 
- **`crates/client`** - The CLI tool (Apache 2.0)
- **`crates/server`** - The server component (BSL 1.1)

## 🚀 Usage

`r_delta` operates in five phases: **Signature**, **Delta**, **Patch**, **Verify**, and **Sync**.

After building, use the compiled binaries directly from `./target/release/`:

### 1\. Signature (The Map)

Generate a lightweight "fingerprint" map of the old file (approx 0.7% of file size).

```bash
./target/release/r_delta signature <OLD_FILE> <SIG_FILE>
```

**Example:**
```bash
./target/release/r_delta signature old_version.bin old.sig
```

### 2\. Delta (The Hybrid Engine)

Compare the new file against the signature. Matches are referenced; new data is compressed.

```bash
./target/release/r_delta delta <SIG_FILE> <NEW_FILE> <PATCH_FILE>
```

**Example:**
```bash
./target/release/r_delta delta old.sig new_version.bin patch.bin
```

### 3\. Patch (The Reassembler)

Reconstruct the new file using the old file and the optimized patch.

```bash
./target/release/r_delta patch <OLD_FILE> <PATCH_FILE> <RECREATED_FILE>
```

**Example:**
```bash
./target/release/r_delta patch old_version.bin patch.bin restored.bin
```

### 4\. Verify (The Auditor)

Perform a high-speed, streaming bit-for-bit comparison to prove integrity.

```bash
./target/release/r_delta verify <ORIGINAL_FILE> <RECREATED_FILE>
```

**Example:**
```bash
./target/release/r_delta verify new_version.bin restored.bin
```

### 5\. Sync (The Network Transport)

Synchronize files to a remote server using automatic delta detection and compression.

#### File Sync

The sync command orchestrates the entire pipeline:
1. Connects to the server
2. Server sends its version's signature (if file exists)
3. Client computes delta automatically
4. Client streams optimized patch to server
5. Server reconstructs and verifies

```bash
./target/release/r_delta sync <FILE> <SERVER:PORT>
```

#### Directory Sync (The Swarm)

Synchronize entire directory trees with intelligent manifest-based coordination and parallel execution:

1. Client builds lightweight manifest (path, size, modified time, BLAKE3 checksum)
2. Client connects to server and sends manifest via QUIC
3. Server generates sync plan:
   - **SendFull**: New files (upload entire file with adaptive strategy)
   - **SendDelta**: Modified files (compute and stream delta patch)
   - **Skip**: Identical files (verified by size + content hash)
   - **Delete**: Files on server but not in client (removed after sync completes)
4. Client executes plan with parallelism:
   - Up to 50 concurrent file transfers simultaneously
   - Saturates bandwidth and hides network latency
   - **Small files (< 100KB)**: Compressed direct upload (30-80% savings, reduced latency)
   - **Large files**: Full CDC delta sync for maximum deduplication
   - Identical files skipped entirely
5. Server applies changes and removes deleted files
6. Both sides verify integrity via BLAKE3 checksums

**Example:**
```bash
# Server (runs continuously)
./target/release/r_delta_server

# Client (in another terminal) - Single file
./target/release/r_delta sync file.bin 127.0.0.1:4433

# Client (in another terminal) - Entire directory
./target/release/r_delta sync-dir /path/to/directory 127.0.0.1:4433
```

### Why r_delta is Fast

1. **Adaptive Transport Strategy**: Automatically selects optimal transfer method (compression vs. delta) based on file size
2. **Content-Defined Chunking**: O(1) hash lookups for chunk matching
3. **BLAKE3 Hashing**: SIMD-optimized cryptographic hashing (4-8x faster than SHA-256)
4. **Zstd Compression**: Industry-leading decompression speed (~10x faster than gzip)
5. **Streaming Architecture**: Constant memory usage regardless of file size
6. **QUIC Protocol**: Multiplexed streams with 0-RTT connection establishment
7. **Fast Directory Walking**: The `ignore` crate (ripgrep engine) with `.gitignore` awareness for quick manifests
8. **Smart Diff Algorithm**: O(n log n) manifest comparison to identify only changed files
9. **Selective File Transfer**: Skips unchanged files entirely, only syncs SendFull/SendDelta actions
10. **Parallel Transfers**: Up to 50 concurrent files saturate bandwidth and hide latency costs

## 🛡️ Stability & Testing

`r_delta` is built for correctness first.

* **Chaos Test(Fuzzing):** The core engine is battle-tested using `proptest`. It has survived thousands of iterations of random file generation, mutation, and reconstruction cycles to ensure `Original == Recreated` is mathematically guaranteed.
* **Memory Safety:** Rust's ownership model combined with a strict 8MB streaming buffer ensures the process never crashes due to OOM, even on 100GB+ files.
* **Type Safety:** The protocol uses `bincode` with strict typing to prevent malformed packets from crashing the server.
